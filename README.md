## Workshop

1. Add the `AlbumCard` component to the app

   1. Add the `AlbumCard` component

1. Use real data from Spotify to get album list
    1. Fetch album data into the state in  CompnentDidMount in App.js
    1. The app should now be able to print several AlbumCard components

1. Make the `AlbumCard` component show something more meaningful
   1. Print image, album name and the name of the artists
